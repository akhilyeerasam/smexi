# The projectIndexGenerator.sh file will contain the sequence for execution of index creation

# The project structure:
# bin - The core logic for creation of an index will be written into files stored here.
# data - The data files referenced from the bin files will be located here, which will be used for index documents
# etc - Other supporting files, such as the index structure definition files
# libAloeEcosystem

# Special thanks to Mr.Heinz Kirchmann and team for allowing reuse of code files they used for their prior projects for generation of indices.
